## Learning Agile and Dynamic Motor Skills
RL research for legged robots was mainly limited to simulation, and only few and comparably simple examples have been deployed on real systems.

## Learning by cheating
Proposed two-stage training procedure, which first train a privileged agent and then using the agent as a teacher to train a purely vision-based system, for effective imitation learning [[1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.12294.pdf)] [[code](https://github.com/dotchen/LearningByCheating)].

## Perceptive locomotion for quadrupeds
Presented a three stage training and deploy method to perform zero-shot sim-to-real transfer [[1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.08117.pdf)]. 
1. a **teacher policy**, which has access to privileged information, is trained to follow a random target velocity over randomly generated terrain with random disturbances.
1. a **student policy** is trained to reproduce the teacher policyâ€™s actions without using this privileged information.
1. transfer the learned student policy to the physical robot and deploy it in the real world with onboard sensors.

## Learning to Walk in Minutes
Presents a training setup that achieves fast policy generation for real-world robotic tasks by using massive parallelism on a single workstation GPU [[1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.11978.pdf)] [[code](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/legged_gym)].
